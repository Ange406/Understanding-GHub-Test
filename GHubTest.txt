Here's my gitTest WITH a fancy FIRST Branch added!

Here's my gitHub Test:

Lots of cool and interesting things.
Trying to figure this all out.
Adding random sentences.
How fun.
NEW BRANCH NUMBER ONE!
SO fun.
I'm hungry. 
I should eat.
That is the end of my GHUB TEST. For now...
I'm back, and adding that I like brussel sprouts.
I love running.
